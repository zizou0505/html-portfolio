<p>I am looking looking for a hobby that may somehow be a source of income that is why I picked Programming. I know I have a long way to go but I am looking forward to the journey of learning this new found hobby of mine.</p>

<p>I am still currently learning and have not yet fully understood what I want to pursue with the skills and knowledge that I will possess. Only the future will tell.</p>
