<h1>The Best Studio Ghibli Movies According to JR</h1>

<h2>My Top 5 Hayao Miyazaki Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986)</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Ghibli film. It tackled humanity, nature, technology, and also teen love. This film introduced me to the retrofuturistic style and steampunk genre of the movie industry.</p>

<p>“No matter how many weapons you have, <br>
   no matter how great your technology might be, <br>
   the world cannot live without love.” -Sheeta <br></p>

<h3>2. Spirited Away (2001)</h3>
<p>This movie introduced me to Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli films. When my cousin was reviewing for her architecture board exam, she stayed in our house for a while. We were kids back then and she would open her laptop playing Ghibli films. This one in particular captured my heart.</p>

<p>"If you completely forget... <br>
   You'll never find your way home." - Haku <br></p>

<h3>3. My Neighbor Totoro (1988)</h3>
<p>This movie is really cute but somehow nostalgic. Everytime I watch this movie, I think of my family's life back in our countryside province.</p>

<p>"Magnificent tree. <br>
   It's been around since long ago, <br>
   Back in the time when people and trees used to be friends." <br>
   - Tatsuo, To Mei & Satsuki</p>

<h3>4. Grave of the Fireflies</h3>
<p>This movie is exceptional but I will never watch it again. It broke my heart into pieces. Just writing this paragraph makes my heart ache.</p>

<p>"Why do fireflies have to die so soon?" - Setsuko</p>

<h3>5. Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>I really liked how imaginative this movie is. Imagine a castle travelling places. Just wow.</p>

<p>"One thing you can always count on is that hearts change."
